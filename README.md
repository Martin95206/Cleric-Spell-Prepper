# Cleric-Spell-Prepper
New to D&amp;D? Try out this spell manager to help new clerics keep track of their spells.

The jar file is the runnable program. If you wish to look at the source code the other files have those details. the Life Domain page contains the valuable comments about different classes as that domain used only cleric spells so it was created first to make the creation of the other pages that much easier. (Comments were added at the end before upload)
